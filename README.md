# Z3-Lua-Hud-BizHawk

Designed for use with BizHawk
Could possibly be adapted for use with Snes9x directly, but that will require Snes9x to have a master version with lua support.

2018-01-22:
  More efficient version of readAsAscii(thanks to Masterjun of TASVideos!)
  Removed Herobrine

Known issues:  

  Key tracking does NOT work outside of Keysanity!  (This is not something I can fix myself since I don't know why it's broken)  
  Switchable items (other than bottles) are tracked based on what is selected in the menu, not by what is available.  
  Similarly:  the Mushroom (and if ever implemented in Rando, the Bottleshrooms and Letter) are no longer tracked once delivered.
